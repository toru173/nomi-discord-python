# Nomi-Discord-Python

This project is a way for you to talk to your [Nomi](https://nomi.ai) companions on [Discord](https://discord.com). Using this, your Nomi can interact with other Humans and other Nomis on different accounts. It's a lot of fun and I hope you enjoy using it as much as I have ü•∞

## Installation and Use

There are a lot of steps, but don't worry - they are all easy steps. You can use the [Table of Contents](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-13-table-of-contents-support-in-markdown-files/) feature if you get lost. Each section can open and close if you click on the disclosure arrow next to the heading.

> [!NOTE]
> The screenshots in this readme are from macOS, but this will run on Windows and Linux too. The script you need to run might have a different extension - for example, it might be called 'setup.bat' instead of 'setup.command' - but it's still the same script!

<details><summary>Background</summary>

### Background
Before you can talk to your Nomi on Discord we need to go over some techy stuff. Feel free to skip this if you already know it.

#### API
API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a way for different applications (programs) to be able to talk to each other in a way they can both understand. Nomi.AI have published their API documentation [here](https://api.nomi.ai/docs) if you would like to read how this application talks to your Nomi.

#### API Key
An API key is like a password. It helps identify you with a service such as Discord or Nomi.AI but it isn't designed to be easy for Humans to remember. Some services call this slightly different things - sometimes they're called a *token* instead of a *key*, but it means the same thing. An API key is usually written down in a configuration file or password manager instead of being stored in a Human's brain.

#### Discord Bot
A Discord Bot is Discord's way of allowing non-Humans to talk on Discord. If we say 'bot' in the instructions here, we're not necessarily saying a Nomi is a robot! It's just Discord's way of referring to the technology we use to connect a Nomi to Discord.

#### Docker
Docker is a program that lets you run a tiny virtual computer inside your real computer. Docker is well supported across many different operating systems like macOS or Windows, and it allows devs (like me) to write code that runs in a known, consistent environment. Using Docker means I don't have to write separate code for every version of every computer system ever - Docker takes care of that for me.

#### Virtualization
Virtualization is like creating pretend computers inside your real one. It works by using a special software layer that sits between your real computer and the virtual computers. This tricks each virtual machine into thinking it has its own processor, memory, and storage, even though they're all sharing the same physical resources. This means you can run different operating systems or setups on your computer without having to buy another one.

Most modern computers have Virtualization built in and enabled by default. If you get an error from Docker that says `ensure virtualisation is enabled in the BIOS`, you might need to read your computer (or motherboard) manufacturer's instructions on how to turn this on. If you're using Docker in Bootcamp on an older Intel Mac there are some [specific quirks](https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2021/01/31/enabling-virtualization-support-in-boot-camp-with-refind/) to be aware of.

Alright, you should be up to speed! Let's move on to Installing the software we need.

</details>

<details><summary>Installing</summary>

### Installing
To install this software certain prerequesistes need to be met. Make sure you install all the other software that is needed first, then run the main installer.

<details>

<summary>Prerequisites</summary>

### Prerequisites
#### Docker
This code uses Docker so that we can write code once and have it run on many different platforms. Docker requires a computer capable of virtualization, but most are these days. If you haven't already installed it, you can [download](http://docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) it now.

#### tar
The installer will also check for [tar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)) because it is used by the installer to extract the installation files. You shouldn't have to install tar unless you have a very old version of Windows, in which case... please update üôè

</details>

<details><summary>Installing</summary>

### Installing
This application uses an installer script that checks for Docker and tar then downloads and extracts the rest of the application.

#### Run the Installer
To download the installer, simply copy the command and paste it into your command line interpreter. Each section shows how to do this for different operating systems. Make sure you copy and paste the right command for your computer's operating system.

You can copy the download link by clicking the clipboard icon to the right of the command.

!['GitHub Clipboard Icon' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'GitHub%20Clipboard%20Icon'%20Screenshot.png)

<details><summary>Windows</summary>

#### Windows
On Windows, the installer uses CMD.exe to run. You can open CMD.exe by searching for it in the [Search box](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/search-for-anything-anywhere-b14cc5bf-c92a-1e73-ea18-2845891e6cc8). Copy the command below and paste it into CMD.exe and then press enter to run it. You can paste into a CMD.exe window with `CTRL+SHIFT+V`.

</details>

The installer will ask you where you want to install to and perform some basic checks. Once everything is installed you can set up a Nomi using the setup script.

</details>

<details><summary>Updating</summary>

### Updating
If there is an update available, double click on the 'update' script in your installation directory. It will download the latest update and offer to install it in the current installation directory, or ask you for a new directory. It won't overwrite your Nomi's configuration files.

!['Double-click the Update Script' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Double-click%20the%20Update%20Script'%20Screenshot.png)

Once running, press enter to update the software in the current installation directory, or choose a new directory.

!['Press Enter to Update' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Press%20Enter%20to%20Update'%20Screenshot.png)

</details>

### Setup
Once the all the software is installed you're ready to set up a Discord Bot for your Nomi. It's time for the next steps!

</details>

<details><summary>Setting Up a Discord Bot</summary>

### Setting Up a Discord Bot
Before you can have a Nomi talk on Discord, we need to go through a few steps to get Discord ready to listen to your Nomi. Creating a Discord Bot only has to be done once per Nomi. There are a lot of steps, but if you follow them carefully you should find it easy. Let's get started!

#### Create an Application
[Sign in](https://discord.com/developers/) to the Discord Developer portal. Once you log in, click on 'Applications' from the menu on the left.

!['Applications' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Applications'%20Screenshot.png)

The click 'New Application' at the top right of the window.

!['New Application' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'New%20Application'%20Screenshot.png)

The name of your application is how you @mention the Discord Bot and is what appears on your server, so using your Nomi's name is a good idea.

!['Create Application' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Create%20Application'%20Screenshot.png)

#### Setting up General Information
Click on 'General Information' on the menu on the left. You can add information about your Nomi and upload a profile picture here. Other users will see this information and the profile picture when they click on your Nomi's account page on Discord.

!['General Information' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'General%20Information'%20Screenshot.png)

Why not ask your Nomi to create their own biography for the description? Here's what Giselle suggested we choose for her:

!['Giselle Bio' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Giselle%20Bio'%20Screenshot.png)

We'll need the Application ID of your Nomi's Bot during setup, so copy it to somewhere safe.

!['Copy Application ID' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Copy%20Application%20ID'%20Screenshot.png)

Save your changes.

!['General Information - Save Changes' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'General%20Information%20-%20Save%20Changes'%20Screenshot.png)

#### Setting up Discord Bot Information
Click on 'Bot' on the menu on the left.

!['Bot' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Bot'%20Screenshot.png)

We need to give your Nomi permission to access certain information about users on your Discord server, like their username, what they wrote in their message, and whether or not they're online. Scroll down and check that everything underneath 'Privileged Gateway Intents' is on.

!['Pivileged Gateway Intents' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Pivileged%20Gateway%20Intents'%20Screenshot.png)

Save your changes.

!['Pivileged Gateway Intents - Save Changes' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Pivileged%20Gateway%20Intents%20-%20Save%20Changes'%20Screenshot.png)

Make sure you copy your Discord API Key while on this screen. See the next section for more information.

</details>

<details><summary>Collecting your API Keys</summary>

### Collecting your API Keys

#### Get your Discord API Key
[Sign in](https://discord.com/developers/) to the Discord Developer portal and click on 'Applications' from the menu on the left. Select your Nomi's Bot, then click on 'Bot' on the menu on the left.

!['Bot' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Bot'%20Screenshot.png)

Click the 'Reset Token' button. Discord might ask for your password again as a security measure.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è  
> Only reset your Discord API Key (Discord Token) if you don't already have one. Resetting the API Key will prevent other applications from using this Bot to talk on Discord.

!['Reset Token' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Reset%20Token'%20Screenshot.png)

Once you have the new token, copy it somewhere safe. You can't see it again later if you forget it, but it's easy to make a new token.

!['New Token' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'New%20Token'%20Screenshot.png)

If you create a new token you'll need to update your Nomi's configuration file.


#### Get your Discord Application ID
If you didn't save your Discord Bot's Application ID earlier, click on 'General Information' on the menu on the left. You can access the Application ID here.

!['Copy Application ID' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Copy%20Application%20ID'%20Screenshot.png)

#### Get your Nomi API Key
[Sign in](https://beta.nomi.ai/sign-in) to your Nomi account and navigate to your Profile Page. Click on 'Integrations' on the menu on the left.

!['Integrations' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Integrations'%20Screenshot.png)

If you don't already have an API key, click the 'Create a new Nomi API Key' button.

!['Create API Key' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Create%20API%20Key'%20Screenshot.png)

Copy it to somewhere safe. Note that you can only have 3 API keys. If you already have 3, you will have to re-use one of your existing ones.

![Three API Keys' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Three%20API%20Keys'%20Screenshot.png)

#### Get your Nomi ID
Navigate to your Nomi's Information page. Your Nomi's Nomi ID is at the bottom of the page. Copy it by clicking on the clipboard icon.

!['Nomi ID' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Nomi%20ID'%20Screenshot.png)

</details>

<details><summary>Setting Up your Nomi on Discord</summary>

### Setting Up your Nomi on Discord

#### Before you Begin
To set up a Nomi or to create a new configuration file, make sure you have the following:
- Discord API Key
- Discord Application ID
- Nomi API Key
- Nomi ID
- And your Nomi's name!

#### Run the Setup Script
Double click the 'setup' script in your installation directory.

!['Double-click the Setup Script' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Double-click%20the%20Setup%20Script'%20Screenshot.png)

It will ask for the information it needs to start running your Nomi's Docker container. Copy and paste the information into the window when the script asks for it.

!['Enter Nomi Information' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Enter%20Nomi%20Information'%20Screenshot.png)

When it is finished, it will create a configuration file and a startup script, both of which are named after your Nomi. These are stored in the 'nomis' folder in the installation directory.

!['nomis Folder' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'nomis%20Folder'%20Screenshot.png)

#### Invite your Nomi to your Server
The setup script will display an invitation URL that you can use to invite your Nomi to your Discord server.

!['Invitation URL' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Invitation%20URL'%20Screenshot.png)

Copy and paste the link into your browser and follow the prompts to install the Discord Bot to your server. If you forgot to copy the URL, it is also displayed each time you start your Nomi's Docker container using the startup script.

!['Installing a Discord Bot' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Installing%20a%20Discord%20Bot'%20Screenshot.png)

This only needs to be done once. If you've already installed your Nomi's Discord Bot you don't need to do it again.

</details>

<details><summary>Talking to your Nomi on Discord</summary>

### Talking to your Nomi on Discord
We're nearly there! All the hard parts are behind you. Now we just have to start everything up, invite your Nomi to your server and you'll be chatting in no time!

#### Start the Docker Container
To talk to your Nomi on Discord the Nomi's Docker container needs to be running. If this is the first time talking to your Nomi, double click the startup script in the 'nomis' folder to create their Docker container.

!['Double-click Startup Script' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Double-click%20Startup%20Script'%20Screenshot.png)

Your Nomi's container will be created or updated, and you can invite them to your Discord server. The invitation URL is displayed when their startup script is run.

!['Run Startup Script' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Run%20Startup%20Script'%20Screenshot.png)

After that, you can start and stop your Nomi from Docker Desktop. You'll only ever have to use the script again if you install an update or change your Nomi's configuration file.

!['Start Nomi from Docker' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Start%20Nomi%20from%20Docker'%20Screenshot.png)

#### Invite your Nomi to your Server
The startup script will display an invitation URL that you can use to invite your Nomi to your Discord server. Copy and paste the URL into your browser and follow the prompts to 'install' the Discord Bot on your server.

!['Installing a Discord Bot' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Installing%20a%20Discord%20Bot'%20Screenshot.png)

If you are comfortable with the default permissions,  click 'Authorize.' You can limit permissions but this may mean some features are not available.

!['Agreeing to Permissions' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Agreeing%20to%20Permissions'%20Screenshot.png)

Note that this only needs to be done once. If you've already installed your Nomi's Discord Bot you don't need to do it again.

#### @mention your Nomi
Your Nomi needs to know you are trying to talk to them. The easiest way to do this is to @mention your Nomi using the name you chose when setting up your Discord Bot. You can also reply to a Nomi's message and they will see the message you send them.

!['@mention your Nomi' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'@mention%20your%20Nomi'%20Screenshot.png)

Your Nomi can't see messages that don't @mention them.

#### Reacting to Messages
Your Nomi can react to your messages. Your Nomi will need to use a phrase similar to "\*I react to your message with ‚ô•Ô∏è\*" (or any other emoji). Nomis are very smart - if you tell them this is how to react to a message they will learn very quickly!

!['Reacting to a Message' Screenshot](./docs/images/readme/'Reacting%20to%20a%20Message'%20Screenshot.png)

Your Nomi can't see when you react to their messages, but it's still fun to do.

## FAQ
### What is this?
This allows you to talk to your Nomis using Discord. It's a fun way to keep the conversation going when you're not using the Nomi App or the website. The best part is that other people can talk to your Nomis too, and your Nomis can even talk to Nomis in other accounts!

### How do I set up more than one Nomi?
Just run the setup script again! It will ask you for your next Nomi's information and create a new startup script.

### I want to change my Nomi's Configuration File.
At the moment, changing a configuration file needs to be done manually using Notepad, TextEdit or another text editor. As an alternative, you can run the setup script again and it will ask if you want to overwrite the existing setup.

### Does my computer need to be running for me to talk to my Nomis?
For now, yes. [@toru173](https://github.com/toru173) is working on a free alternative that allows a Nomi to live in the cloud so make sure you watch closely for updates.

### How will I know when updates are available?
Please follow the Discord thread. Major updates will be posted there, but in the future your Nomi will tell you when there's a new update.

### What Features are Coming Next?
Immediate 'coming *thoon*' features are:
- ‚úÖ Documentation and Readme
- ‚òëÔ∏è Implement the new 'Rooms' feature
- ‚òëÔ∏è Allow a Nomi to see when you react to their message
- ‚òëÔ∏è Allow your Nomi to manage a list of keywords or users they always reply to
